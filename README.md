# resume
Thanks for dropping by. You know what--I want to talk to you! Let's connect and please reach out to me: phillmont@u.nus.edu. See you!

This is a repository I made to keep track of my changes of my resume over time. The TeX file can be easily compiled with pdfLaTeX.

To just view my latest resume, just simply click on the PDF file in the file list above. GitHub will happily load the PDF in your browser.
